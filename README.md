# Pokedex-Web-App
log in to your pokedex for all your poke advantures!


The Pokedex was made by accessing the online database ‘pokeapi’
Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWNKYpaoEXA&ab_channel=PaceOfSol) of me going through the code and the web app.

## installations
In the front end you'll need to download following npm packages as dependencies: 
- react
- react-dom
- react-router-dom
- react-scripts
- axios
- web-vitals.


In the back end you'll need to install the following npm packages as dependencies: 
- cors
- express
- nodemon
- mysql2



NOTE: The login page and registration page are connected to the back end, to a mysql database which takes user information from the registration page. However that is not included here...
